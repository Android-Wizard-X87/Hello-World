# Hello-World
1st Project 😎
Ive been learning to do simple 
coding/flashing/ect for about a year now
and I've been self-teaching up to this point
because I'm determined to learn these sets of
skills, I'm very interested in everything
Android and digital 😎👊 Learning about GitHub
and joining this site is a great step
in the right direction to learning, mastery,
and... SUCCESS 👍
